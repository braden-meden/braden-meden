- 👋 Hi, I’m @braden-meden
- 👀 I’m interested in coding (obviously), but I love reading, collaborative education, and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Responsive Web Design on freeCodeCamp and I'm going back to school for software development this fall.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all projects I can make myself useful on. Any experience is good experience.
- 📫 How to reach me: the best way to reach me is probably Discord (my username is braden_meden) or you can find me on most social medias @braden_meden.
